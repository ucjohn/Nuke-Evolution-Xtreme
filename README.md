## Installation and Upgrade

While Nuke Evolution Xtreme uses the same core as Nuke Evolution Basic there have been a lot of updates to it which improve performance and security, please see the following links for installing a fresh copy or upgrading.

##### NOTE



## Security

Security is the top priority for this CMS, the core of Nuke Evolution uses a comprehensive integrated module call Nuke Sentinel (tm). Nuke Sentinel (tm) protects your website against DDOS, CLIKE, Union and many more attacks, Nuke Sentinel (tm) is so advanced you don't even have to worry about protecting your admin panel as it watches for failed logins and can ban anonymous users automatically from your website.

Hopefully you will never have to visit the admin panel for Nuke Sentinel (tm) as 99% of all webhosts now have DDOS protection and many more security features which prevent attacks and such.
